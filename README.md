# BestShop-LandingPage + calc (SCSS)

During my time at Coderslab, I worked on a project to bring a pre-designed website to life with responsive designs for desktop, 
mobile, and tablet views. I was responsible for bringing the design to life through coding and ensuring the website was functional 
and user-friendly across different devices. This project provided valuable hands-on experience in front-end development 
and allowed me to expand my technical skills.
